There is one NOTE:
  ```
  Namespaces in Imports field not imported from:
  ‘heatmaply’ ‘markdown’ ‘plotly’ ‘scales’ ‘shinythemes’, ‘DT’
  All declared Imports should be used.
  ```

These libraries are used within a Shiny app that is packaged inside the `inst` directory of the app- thus, although none of the new functions in `ranacapa` require these packages, running the Shiny app at the core of this package does require these packages.
