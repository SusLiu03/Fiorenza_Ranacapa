## Number of Reads and Relative Abundance

A question that may arise as you work is if there is more of some taxon in one area compared to another. This question though is impossible to answer with the vast majority of eDNA data sets. eDNA data sets contain information on the number of reads of a particular sequence that was found in a sample. This number though is not equal to abundance and lots of factors can influence the amount of reads returned, including size of an organism, time since it was there, weather and degradation of DNA, propensity to being easily sequenced and amplified, etc. Therefore, use caution when interpreting the number of reads based on the samples. 

One way to account for these issues is to use relative (sequence) abundance. Relative abundance standardizes the number of reads in a sample to the total number of reads in that sample and presents the information as a percentage that will always sum to 100%. However, care is still needed when interpreting this data as it still doesn't address issues of DNA shedding rates and amounts by different organisms.
