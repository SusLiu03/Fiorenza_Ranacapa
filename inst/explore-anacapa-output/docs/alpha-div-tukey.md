## Post-hoc tests

The ANOVA table above can only reveal whether there is a difference in diversity among sites- so even if we find that diversity varies among sites, there is no way of knowing *which* sites are different from each other. In other words -- we might know from the ANOVA above that Sites A, B, and C are not all equally diverse, but we don't know whether diversity in Site A is different from that in Site B, or whether Site A differes only from Site C, and so on. 

One way to explore this further is via a [post-hoc Tukey test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukey%27s_range_test), which compares each group against each other and adjusts for running multiple comparisons. Note that the following results are meaningful only if the ANOVA table above suggests that sites are in fact unequal in terms of their diversity. The results from the Tukey test are presented below:
