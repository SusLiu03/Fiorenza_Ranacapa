## Clustering samples according to taxonomy

Another way to visualize similarity between plots is via a [cluster analysis](https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/cluster.html), which groups sites together according to their taxonomic composition. One way to do this is with [Ward's Hierarchical Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method) method, which we implement below. Sites with more similar taxonomic composition will cluster together in this analysis. Please note that this figure does not change according the selected variable.
